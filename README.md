## âœ¨ Highlights

- Beautiful, responsive UI built with React + Vite.
- Role-driven workflows (Submitter / Reviewer / Approver).
- Full frontend mock API for local development (no backend required).
- Clean layouts: sticky header + footer, fixed left navigation, spacious cards.

---

## Quick start (frontend)

```powershell
# from project root
cd C:\Users\kunal\DocuFlow
npm install
npm run dev
# then open http://localhost:5173
```

> The frontend uses Vite and React (TSX). If you prefer pnpm or yarn, those work too.

## Backend (optional)

The project includes a Spring Boot backend under `backend/`. You can run it if you need the full stack features (MongoDB, Pulsar integrations):

```powershell
cd backend
mvn -DskipTests spring-boot:run
```

Configuration is in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (port 9090 by default).
